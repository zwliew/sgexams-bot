# r/SGExams Bot

# Introduction
This bot is written in `Typescript` using `Discord.js`  - [https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/)
It uses `SQLite3` to store persistent code.

# Getting Started
1. `git clone` this repository.
2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. `npm i` to install dependencies.
4. Add `BOT_TOKEN="your discord bot token"` to a file called `.env` in the root of this project.
5. You're ready!
   * `npm run build` to transpile the code into `javascript`. Output files can be found in `./build`
   * `npm start` to run the transpiled code.
   * `npm run dev` to use `ts-node-dev` for hot-reloading during development.
   * `npm test` to run tests.
   * `npx eslint ./src/**` to check for code style violations.

# Migrating to SQlite3
Before porting to `SQLite3`, storage was deserialised and saved into a json file. Here are the steps to convert the json into a `SQLite3` Database.

1. `node database/migrate.js`
2. If there is no errors in the console, we're done. Double check with a DB Browser Application to confirm that the data has been ported over properly.
